This will help search engines definitively connect the brand's digital footprint, addressing the low Citation Authority (38/100) and low Visibility Score (48/100) by strengthening the Knowledge Graph presence.",

    "description": "Execute a full audit of Name, Address, and Phone (NAP) consistency across all indexed directories. While 'Missing From' is none, the low Citation Authority indicates high levels of data fragmentation or conflicting information. Consolidating these via API-driven tools will prevent authority dilution and improve local/organic search signals.",

This leverages the positive Sentiment Score (75/100) to increase Click-Through Rates (CTR), which indirectly signals higher relevance to search engines and boosts the overall Visibility Score.",
